        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Urban Planning as a Design Problem </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Saturday, November 8 </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">All Day Ticket: $20 (Limited to 100) </p>

<p>The design of a city influences our every day experience, it’s economic health, and how a sense of community can be fostered.  The films featured on Saturday portray urban planning as a design problem and include the mesmerizing Urbanized, the inspiring Rock the Boat, and a fascinating segment from the locally produced work-in-progress Saving the City.  The day will end with a panel discussion on the evolution of San Francisco’s in-town new town, Mission Bay, a neighborhood designed from scratch.  As part of the panel, Ron Blatman, producer and director of Saving the City will discuss how he chose Mission Bay as the focus of the San Francisco segment in this upcoming PBS TV series.

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Urban Planning as a Search for Social Equity </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">Sunday, November 9 </p>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">All Day Ticket: $20 (Limited to 100) </p>

<p>We all seek to be heard and appreciated.  Urban planning, when viewed through the lens as a search for social equity, recognizes the contributions of all segments of the population in making our cities vibrant and resilient.  In this light, urban planning is a complex system of individual rights, public policies, private markets, and cultural values which often times conflict but as often, converge.  The films on Sunday illuminate the struggle for social equity as cities carry out housing, economic development and transportation strategies with the intent of improving the lives of all but with controversial results.  The Pruitt-Igoe Myth deconstructs the myth perpetuated by the image seared into our collective unconscious of a public housing project imploding.  The Fillmore tells the story of a beloved neighborhood in San Francisco rocked by World War II and mid-century Federal urban policy.  5 Blocks is a work in progress showing the changes happening in real time in downtown San Francisco’s Central Market Street area. 
        </p>

        <p>Join the filmmakers of The Fillmore, Peter L. Stein, 5 Blocks, Robert Cortland and Dan Goldes, and the author of “Cool Gray City of Love: 49 Views of San Francisco” and Executive Editor of San Francisco magazine, Gary Kamiya, as they discuss how each of them approached their stories of neighborhood change. </p>
